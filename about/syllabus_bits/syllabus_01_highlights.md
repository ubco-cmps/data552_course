### How do I contact the teaching team?

- For official course communication, I will use {{ ANNOUNCEMENTS_LINK }}, please note that replies to announcements will not be monitored and you should use {{ FORUM_LINK.replace('JOIN_LINK', ED_ID) }} for that.
- For **all** course-related questions you can reach out to the teaching team including instructors and TAs via {{ FORUM_LINK.replace('JOIN_LINK', ED_ID) }}. 
- You are encouraged to post questions publicly whenever possible so others can benefit. For private and personal issues, you can send private messages on {{ FORUM_LINK.replace('JOIN_LINK', ED_ID) }}.
- Any student may visit the office hour for any member of the teaching team (TA or instructor)! In other words, you can go to the office hour of ANY TA, not just the one whose lab/tutorial you are registered in.
