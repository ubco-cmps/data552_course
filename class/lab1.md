# Writing Assignment \#1 - Email Memo

This assignment requires a 15-minute consultation with Maya Pilin, the course TA: <maya.pilin@ubc.ca>

## Instructions

Please read the four (4) communication pieces below carefully and
identify the type of communication, the topic, the intended audience (and any supplementary audiences), the purpose, and the context.

- [Harris fumbles on health insurance by Chris Stirewalt
(Jan. 29 2019)](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-fumbles-on-health-insurance)
- [Making an interactive UMAP visualization of the MNIST data set by
Grant Jan. 29 2019](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/01/29/making-an-interactive-umap-visualization-of-the-mnist-data-set.html)
- [Population & Housing in Kelowna (2018)](https://www.kelowna.ca/sites/files/1/docs/related/ff-population_and_housing.pdf)
- [Dear Ms. Fratelli email](./EmailExample.pdf)

Once you have identified the writing (rhetorical) situation for each text, consider the type of information and level of detail included in each document.
Consider also the word choice, sentence structure, organization, and presentation of each text.
How would you describe each of the different texts?

In pairs (or 3s), draft an email memo that summarizes your conclusions.
Discuss your findings and your email draft with Maya and your partner.
Revise your email and send it to Maya by the deadline.

## Formatting and Organization

The email memo (750-1000 words) should include a specific subject line that provides an “at a glance” introduction to the email’s content. The first paragraph should communicate the purpose of the email, and the email should end with a closing statement and valediction (i.e., Sincerely, Best, Cheers, etc.).

If the email consists of multiple paragraphs and sections, the sections should be offset with a heading and incorporate bullet points as appropriate.
Remember, the reader should be able to identify the main points at a glance.

Should the email extend beyond five paragraphs, you may wish to consider including your conclusions in a separate document and using the body of the email as a cover letter. 
Both the email and the attachment (if you include one) should be written in “plain English” and incorporate a professional tone and style characterized by active voice, complete sentences, and specific, concise, gender-neutral language.

## Grading Rubric
