# DATA 552 - Presentation 1 (General Audience)

## Logistics

- Presentations will be done on Thursday March 11, 2021 during the DATA 552 lecture (10 - 11 AM) **and** the DATA 552 lab (1:30 - 3:30 PM).
- Priority for the lecture slot will be given to those for whom the lab section is in the middle of the night.
- You are expected to attend and provide feedback to all of talks.
- Presentations will be recorded, but you **must** attend the lecture and the lab during the presentations unless you make prior arrangements with the instructor.

## Information for the Audience

- Listen attentively and respectfully
- Provide quantitative feedback to presenters in the form of a survey (details during session)
- Provide detailed feedback to the group (details during session)

## Information for the Presenters

- Design and deliver a **15 minute oral presentation** of your preliminary dashboard.
- Answer any questions during the question-period, which will last a total of **5 mins**
- Your audience is a **general audience**, is university-educated, but has no training in statistics or data science.
- Your dashboard is not expected to be in a finished-state, but whatever you show, should be working as intended (if an experimental feature does not work, don't demo it during the talk, you can bring it up during the question period though).

### Visuals

You should incorporate some visuals in your talk. These could take the form of slides or physical props, or you could draw on the Zoom whiteboard.

Don't think of your visuals as a document that your audience could refer to after the talk; that's what your blog post (or final report) is for. 
Your visuals are meant to *supplement your talk in real time*, so put some thought into it! 

In this presentation, *misusing visuals* or *missing opportunities to use visuals to enhance understanding* will affect your marks. 

By *misusing visuals*, I mean things like this:

* Using lots of text on your slides. (I'm not saying you have to use *no* text – I'm just saying that if you use it, it should be concise, focused, and purposeful.)
* Failing to explain what a particular graph is showing. (I highly recommend that you explicitly point out what variables are represented on each axis.)
* Including spelling errors, grammar errors, or sloppy formatting.

By *missing opportunities to use visuals to enhance understanding*, I mean things like this:

* You're describing a particular code snippet, but you're not showing it.
* You're describing a distribution, but you're not showing a graph of it.
* You're describing an equation, but you're not showing it.
* You're describing an algorithm or process that has a visual or geometric interpretation, but you're not showing it.

### Tools for creating visuals

You are encouraged to use any of the tools/languages introduced to you in MDS (Jupyter RISE, R Markdown, R, python, etc...).
However, you will not be assessed on your choice of tool or language.

## Evaluation

Presenters will be graded according to the reasoning rubric (40%) and the presentations rubric (60%).
I have pasted them below for you to examine.

### Grading Rubric for Reasoning

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>No attempt (0)</th>
    <th>Poor (F)</th>
    <th>Unsatisfactory (D)</th>
    <th>Satisfactory (C- to C+)</th>
    <th>Good (B- to B+)</th>  
    <th>Excellent (A- to A+)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    
   <td>Not attempted.</td>
   <td>Submission does not address question asked or makes no sense.</td>
    
   <td>Submission lacks a purpose, little to no understanding of the learning material is displayed, important information is lacking. The text may contradict itself, or obvious gaps in the argument are present. <br/><br/>In the case of short-answer questions, the incorrect answer was attained and the wrong method was used.
<br/><br/> Analysis is lacking (if it is required).
<br/><br/> Reasoning is flawed or insufficient, does not accurately back up claim, or no clear thesis established.
<br/><br/> Structure of argument is confusing and poorly laid-out; if this is a written submission, the reader may have to jump back and forth through the text. Any figures included are not labelled clearly or sensibly.
</td>
    
   <td>There is purpose to the submission, some understanding of the learning material is demonstrated.
<br/><br/>In the case of short-answer questions, the correct or approximately correct method was used.
<br/><br/> Analysis is mostly correct but may be lacking in-depth.
<br/><br/> Thesis, arguments and reasoning are present but do not strongly back up the thesis.
<br/><br/> Structure of argument is somewhat clear. Paragraph delineation could be improved (if this is a written submission). Included figures labels need more clarity/could be better.
</td>
    <td>There is a clear purpose to the submission, understanding of the learning material is demonstrated.
<br/><br/>In the case of short-answer questions, the correct or approximately correct method was used.
<br/><br/> Analysis is correct and sufficiently in-depth if required.
<br/><br/> Thesis is clear and the arguments and reasoning presented back up the thesis well.
<br/><br/> Structure of argument is clear and delineated sensibly into paragraphs if this is a written submission. Included figures are labelled clearly and sensibly.
</td>
    <td>Mastery of the learning material is demonstrated, original ideas may be presented.
<br/><br/>In the case of short-answer questions, the correct method was used and the correct result attained.
<br/><br>Analysis is thorough and exhaustive without being drawn out or lacking focus.
<br/><br/>Thesis is clear and the arguments that support it are flawless and very well-reasoned, leaving no obvious gaps.
<br/><br/> Structure of argument is very clear and straightforward; in the case of a written submisison, the reader almost never has to jump back and forth unless clearly instructed to do so by references.

    <th></th>
    <th>No attempt (0)</th>
    <th>Poor (F)</th>
    <th>Unsatisfactory (D)</th>

  <tr>
    <th>Engagement & Clarity (40%)</th>
    <td>Not Attempted</td>
    <td>Speaker gives a presentation that is so short, shallow, or confusing that it was clear that no effort was made.</td>
    <td>Words are spoken quietly or the speaker does not enunciate so that few or no listeners can understand; speaker lacks enthusiasm; speaker pauses frequently and cannot remember what to say; speaker ignores the audience and never makes eye contact; speaker constantly reads off the slides.</td>
    <td>Speaker can make it through the presentation without significant stumbling; speaker mostly projects so that the evaluator can hear clearly; speaker occasionally makes eye contact with the audience.</td>
    <td>Speaker projects so that everyone can hear almost everything, although there may be a couple moments where the speaker trails off; speaker enunciates clearly with relatively few umms and ahhs; eye contact is fairly consistent, and body language is mostly natural and open.</td>
    <td>Speaker projects so that everyone can hear throughout the whole presentation; speaker enunciates clearly and enthusiastically without mumbling or slurring; eye contact is held and body language is used to enhance the verbal presentation; the speaker can smile and entertain the audience; the speaker does not simply read off the slides; the time limit is respected; the speaker looks to the audience or even interacts with them in order to gauge their understanding and adjust the pace accordingly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Use of Visuals (40%)</th>
    <td>Not Attempted</td>
    <td>Speaker missed all opportunities to enhance their presentation with visuals.</td>
    <td>Speaker designed some form of visuals, but doesn't follow any best practices. Visuals may have large blocks of text, unannotated graphs, jarring color schemes, or otherwise confusing designs. Slides may be riddled with typos.</td>
    <td>Speaker designed visuals that could have been useful as supplements to the presentation, but fails to use them effectively. (For example, graphs may be reasonably well-designed, but the speaker doesn't explain their axes or help the audience understand their messages.) Speaker may be distracted by their own visuals, or may inadvertently cause the visuals to compete with their own words for the audience's attention. There are multiple typos.</td>
    <td>Visuals are well designed and almost always used to good effect. Fonts, colors, images, or whitespace could use minor improvements. There may be one or two typos.</td>
    <td>Visuals are impeccably designed and were consistently used to enhance the speaker's message. Fonts, colors, images, and whitespace are deliberately chosen and arranged in a way that is not only effective, but pleasing to the eye. There are no typos.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Questions & Answers (20%)</th>
    <td>Not Attempted</td>
    <td>Speaker lacks ability to answer questions or even understand them, cannot elaborate on any ideas discussed in the presentation, and does not display good understanding of the material.</td>
    <td>Speaker can answer questions with some confidence, but their answers may be inaccurate, contradictory, misleading, or very difficult to understand.</td>
    <td>Speaker can answer questions accurately, but not effectively — doesn't seem to anticipate confusion or realize why the question was posed.</td>
    <td>Speaker can answer questions accurately and effectively with little trouble formulating responses.</td>
    <td>Speaker can answer questions accurately and confidently and even elaborate; if the speaker is unsure they can speculate thoughtfully, but not pose the speculation as fact.</td>
