# Writing Assignment #4 - Report

**Due:** March 25th, 2021

## Instructions

Please write a 5- to 6-page report that briefly outlines the problem you identified in your proposal (assignment 2), presents an analysis of the relevant data, and includes a conclusion illustrating the significance of your findings.

As with the proposal, your primary objective will be to determine what the audience needs to know, and then to communicate the information in a way that audience will understand and be able to act on.

*If necessary, your report can be up to 10-pages long.

## Content, Organization, Formatting

The report will need to include five components: 

1. An executive summary that provides a comprehensive overview of the rest of the report (no more than a paragraph)
2. An introduction that outlines the problem and its significance; the introduction should also tell the reader what question(s) the report will answer
3. An overview and analysis of your findings, including at least one graphic and a description of any trends or patterns that you’ve observed
4. A conclusion that either a.) makes a recommendation based on your analysis or b.) provides insight to the greater significance of your findings (what this might mean for the company or general public)
5. A references page that lists all of the sources used in either APA or Chicago style

The report should make use of white space, headings, and bullet point lists as appropriate. Ideas should flow logically and take the audience on a hero’s journey.

The tone is formal. Sentences are clear, concise, specific, and written in active voice. There is no use of jargon.
