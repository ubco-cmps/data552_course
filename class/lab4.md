# Writing Assignment #4 - Report

**Due:** March 25th, 2021

## Instructions

Please write a 5- to 6-page report that briefly outlines the problem you identified in your proposal (assignment 2), presents an analysis of the relevant data, and includes a conclusion illustrating the significance of your findings.

As with the proposal, your primary objective will be to determine what the audience needs to know, and then to communicate the information in a way that audience will understand and be able to act on.

*If necessary, your report can be up to 10-pages long.

## Content, Organization, Formatting

The report will need to include five components: 

1. An executive summary that provides a comprehensive overview of the rest of the report (no more than a paragraph)
2. An introduction that outlines the problem and its significance; the introduction should also tell the reader what question(s) the report will answer
3. An overview and analysis of your findings, including at least one graphic and a description of any trends or patterns that you’ve observed
4. A conclusion that either a.) makes a recommendation based on your analysis or b.) provides insight to the greater significance of your findings (what this might mean for the company or general public)
5. A references page that lists all of the sources used in either APA or Chicago style

The report should make use of white space, headings, and bullet point lists as appropriate. Ideas should flow logically and take the audience on a hero’s journey.

The tone is formal. Sentences are clear, concise, specific, and written in active voice. There is no use of jargon.

## Submission Requirements

The report and presentation will need to be placed in the repository and the link to the assignment should be submitted on Canvas. 

## Rubric

Document(s) should be uploaded to the repository and a link should be submitted to Canvas (you can use the lab2 repository).

### Good Grade Level Criteria

* Content and Organization
  + On the whole, the document flows smoothly from one idea to the next, but there may be one or two abrupt transitions.
  + The report includes an executive summary that provides a comprehensive overview that answers the reader’s most important question. However, this summary may be a bit too detailed and may exceed the one-paragraph.
  + The introduction includes a brief statement of the report’s purpose and a summary of conclusions, but it provides a little bit too much, or a not quite enough context.
  + The body of the report anticipates the reader’s questions, and answers them accordingly, but there is room to improve the organization of ideas. There may be some repetition and/or some points may be under/over explained.
  + Headings are specific, but they could be used more strategically to help the reader identify key ideas and points.
  + The conclusion begins to give specific recommendation, or, if recommendations are not appropriate, a summary of key trends. However, there is a lingering sense that the report hasn’t fully connected with the reader’s (business) objectives.
  + All secondary sources are properly acknowledged and cited within the report. They are also referenced at the end of the document.
  
* Writing Quality 
  + Sentences are generally clear and easy to read. However, there may be some areas were word choice could be improved.
  + Some sentences may be a bit wordy.
  + Tone is formal, though there may be some casual expressions.
  + While the language is generally easy to understand, there may be terms and phrases that assume the reader is comfortable and familiar with the technical content.

* Presentation
  + The document has a professional appearance, but there may be room to improve formatting (if, for example, one were to hand this off to a busy executive that one is trying to impress).
  + Fonts are easy to read and used consistently
  + Headings and bullet points are used to appropriately and consistently. However, there may be room to improve formatting and organization.
  + White space is used well, but content may be a bit too crowded at times
  + Graphics are generally well formatted and begin to help ethically highlight important ideas. Graphics generally follow the four basic principles of design.
  
### Satisfactory Grade Level Criteria

* Content and Organization
  + The document flows relatively well from one idea to the next. However, there is considerable repetition and many abrupt and/or awkward transitions.
  + There is an executive summary, but the summary is either too long or too short. It answers the reader’s most important question on a very superficial level and gives no indication of how the report came to that conclusion or what the reader should do with the information.
  + The introduction is either too long, and provides so much detail that the reader has a difficult time identifying the main idea, or it is so short that the reader has almost no context to frame their understanding of the rest of the document.
  + The body of the report answers many questions that are related to the reader’s (business) needs. However, the body doesn’t fully explain these ideas and doesn’t always connect them to the reader’s key question.
  + Headings are generic and do not help the reader identify key points.
  + There is a conclusion, but this conclusion provides only a rudimentary discussion of what the reader’s next steps are, or, if recommendations are not appropriate, the conclusion doesn’t remind the reader of key trends in the data.
  + Secondary sources are acknowledged, but there are points where it is not absolutely clear where ideas/words come from.

* Writing Quality
  + Sentences may lack clarity and there is a noticeable room to improve word choice and grammar.
  + Tone is often casual.
  + Sentences are wordy.
  + The proposal often relies on industry specific terminology, which may not be understood by a general audience.

* Presentation
  + While care has gone into preparing a professional document, considerable improvement is needed before one could submit the document to a business executive that one is trying to impress.
  + Fonts are easy to read and used consistently, though there may be minor errors.
  + Headings and bullet points are present but they may be used inconsistently. There is noticeable room for improvement in organization.
  + White space is used, but content is fairly crowded. White space isn’t used to help the reader focus on key ideas.
  + Graphics have a general sense of formatting, but more thought could have gone into content and placement. Little thought has gone into the four basic principles of design.
  + The graphics may be misleading.

### Unsatisfactory Grade Level Criteria

* Content and Organization
  + The report begins to follow a logical order, but the audience has to work really hard to find connections between ideas.
  + There may not be an executive summary. If one exists, it does not anticipate the audience’s needs.
  + The introduction either spends so much time discussing the problem that the reader forgets the purpose of the document, or the introduction is so short that the reader doesn’t know why they are reading the document.
  + The body of the report makes a number of interesting points, but these points are not connected to questions the reader may have. In other words, the information is not tied back to the reader’s (business) needs.
  + The conclusion, if present, is very brief. It leaves the reader with more questions than answers.
  + There is a general sense of where ideas and words come from, but there are many instances where secondary sources are not (properly) acknowledged.
  
* Writing Quality
  + Sentences are often incomplete and difficult to follow.
  + Language is very vague and/or very industry specific. It is assumed that the audience has the same level of knowledge about the subject matter as the writer.
  + Sentences are very wordy.
  + Tone reminds one of a text-message between friends

* Presentation
  + Little care has gone into giving the document a professional appearance.
  + There is some inconsistency in font use.
  + Headings and bullet points are present but they do little to help organize and highlight ideas. There may be formatting inconsistencies.
  + There is some white space, but it is not used strategically.
  + Graphics appear to have been added as an after-thought. Their purpose is not explained.
  + The graphics, if present, are misleading
  
### Poor Grade Level Criteria

* Content and Organization
  + There is some sense of organization, but very little, if any thought has gone into the reader’s needs.
  + The report jumps around from idea to idea. There is no clear introduction, body, or conclusion.
  + The executive summary is missing.
  + There may not be an introduction. If one exists, it is difficult to distinguish from the body.
  + The body indicates only a preliminary sense of the audience’s needs. There is very little, if any, explanation as to how the report came to its conclusions.
  + The conclusion, if present, incorporates new information.
  + Secondary sources are not properly acknowledged.
  + There may be instances of plagiarism or patchwriting.

* Writing Quality
  + Sentences are often incomplete and very difficult to follow.
  + Language is vague and or inappropriate for the audience.
  
* Presentation
  + Very little, if any, thought has gone into the audience’s reading experience.
  + Headings and bullet points appear to have been added as an after-thought.
  + Graphics, if present, are messy and do little, if anything, to highlight important ideas.
  + Graphics, if present, are very misleading.
