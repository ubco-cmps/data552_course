# Writing Assignment #3 - Data Visualization and Blog Post

**Due:** March 18th, 2021

## Instructions

As you know, data can be manipulated in many different ways, some more problematic than others. The presentation of data can also be manipulated to highlight the narrative the presenter would like told. This means that data is sometimes used to paint pictures and promote stories that mislead and manipulate the audience.

### **The Visual Component:** 

For this assignment, I would like you to use the dataset (or part of the dataset) you’ve selected for the proposal and report assignments and (re)present the information in three different visuals. Each visual should be accompanied by a one- to two-sentence description. Each visual and description should tell a different narrative.

### **The Blog Post:**

Then, I would like you to write a 750- to 1000-word blog post for a general audience (i.e., not data scientists) that explains what message each (re)presentation promotes and how you were able to manipulate the data to tell this story. Here you might explain how your selection of data, the visual (re)presentation of the data, and the written description work to change the
narrative (message) each (re)presentation communicates.  

I would also like you to explain which representation communicates the most realistic and ethical narrative and why.

## Content, Organization, Formatting

When drafting this assignment, start by thinking about the blogs you like to read: how much content is included? How is the blog organized? How is it formatted?

### Content:
Your blog post will be written for a general audience. They will not be familiar with technicalterms common in the data science realm. As such, the blog will need to be written in very simple, every-day language that anyone can understand. You are aiming for a grade 6 to 8 reading level on the [Hemingway Editor] (http://www.hemingwayapp.com/).  

### Organization:
There is no set organizational structure for a blog post. However, you do want to put the most important information at the top. Think of the [Pyramid Principle] (https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7).

You’ll also want to structure your blog “keeping skimmers and scanners in mind” (Patel, n.d., https://neilpatel.com/blog/12-writing-and-formatting-tactics-to-get-your-longest-posts-read/). Could the reader understand the main ideas in your blog by just scanning? While this is a very “marketer-y” blog and while some of data is clearly being used to sell the author’s point, there
are some good suggestions in this post.  

### Formatting:

Your blog will most likely be read on a small screen (a tablet of some sort, a mobile phone, or a computer). Thus, you will want to keep your paragraphs short and make frequent use of headings and bullet-points. You will also want to ensure that you do not crowd the page with text and imagery. You need to leave the reader’s eyes some space.
