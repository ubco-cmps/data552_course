# Writing Assignment #3 - Data Visualization and Blog Post

**Due:** March 18th, 2021

## Instructions

As you know, data can be manipulated in many different ways, some more problematic than others. The presentation of data can also be manipulated to highlight the narrative the presenter would like told. This means that data is sometimes used to paint pictures and promote stories that mislead and manipulate the audience.

### **The Visual Component:** 

For this assignment, I would like you to use the dataset (or part of the dataset) you’ve selected for the proposal and report assignments and (re)present the information in three different visuals. Each visual should be accompanied by a one- to two-sentence description. Each visual and description should tell a different narrative.

### **The Blog Post:**

Then, I would like you to write a 750- to 1000-word blog post for a general audience (i.e., not data scientists) that explains what message each (re)presentation promotes and how you were able to manipulate the data to tell this story. Here you might explain how your selection of data, the visual (re)presentation of the data, and the written description work to change the
narrative (message) each (re)presentation communicates.  

I would also like you to explain which representation communicates the most realistic and ethical narrative and why.

## Content, Organization, Formatting

When drafting this assignment, start by thinking about the blogs you like to read: how much content is included? How is the blog organized? How is it formatted?

### Content:
Your blog post will be written for a general audience. They will not be familiar with technicalterms common in the data science realm. As such, the blog will need to be written in very simple, every-day language that anyone can understand. You are aiming for a grade 6 to 8 reading level on the [Hemingway Editor] (http://www.hemingwayapp.com/).  

### Organization:
There is no set organizational structure for a blog post. However, you do want to put the most important information at the top. Think of the [Pyramid Principle] (https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7).

You’ll also want to structure your blog “keeping skimmers and scanners in mind” (Patel, n.d., https://neilpatel.com/blog/12-writing-and-formatting-tactics-to-get-your-longest-posts-read/). Could the reader understand the main ideas in your blog by just scanning? While this is a very “marketer-y” blog and while some of data is clearly being used to sell the author’s point, there
are some good suggestions in this post.  

### Formatting:

Your blog will most likely be read on a small screen (a tablet of some sort, a mobile phone, or a computer). Thus, you will want to keep your paragraphs short and make frequent use of headings and bullet-points. You will also want to ensure that you do not crowd the page with text and imagery. You need to leave the reader’s eyes some space.

### Good Grade Level Criteria

* Data Visuals
    + The graphics follow the four basic principles of design: unity, variety, balance, and emphasis, however there may be room for improvement (i.e., sizing, slight organization issues)
    + The visuals begin to present three different narratives but the narratives are not as distinct as they could be.
    + The visuals are clear and easy to read but there may be minor inconsistencies.

    + The blog follows the pyramid principle in that it includes the most important information at the top

    + Paragraphs are no more than 6-lines long, but there may be one or two that are a bit longer or some that are too short. 
    + The blog follows a logical progression: every idea flows into the next. However, there may be some points that cause the reader to pause briefly. 
    + The blog anticipates a general audience and communicates complex ideas in a simple and easy to understand manner, but occasionally slips into technical terminology. 
    + The blog explains how the data in each image was manipulated, but the explanation could be simpler for a non-data-scientist to understand. 
    + The blog identifies the most realistic (re)presentation of data and gives a general explanation as to why this is the most holistic (re)presentation.

* Writing Quality 
    + Sentences are generally clear and easy to read, though there may be some areas where word choice could be improved.

### Satisfactory Grade Level Criteria

* Data Visuals
    + The graphics follow the four basic principles of design: unity, variety, balance, and emphasis, however they are not easy for a general audience to understand. 
    + The visuals begin to present three different narratives but there are only minor distinctions between them. 
    + The reader can read the images, but they might be a bit small or the colours make it difficult to understand the message. 
 
* Blog Content and Organization
    + The blog is clearly organized but doesn't follow the pyramid principle. 
    + Headings and subheadings are present  but they are not very specific. They may be catchu but are misleading and may not be used consistently.

    + The blog spends little time anticipating the audience's needs and knowledge level. There is a lot of technical language. 
    + The blog begins to explain how the data was manipulated, but it doesn't fully develop the explanation.  
    + The blog identifies the most realistic (re)presentation of data, but it spends very little time clarifying why this is the most realistic example. 

* Writing Quality 
    + Sentences may lack clarity and there is a noticeable room to improve word choice and grammar.

### Unsatisfactory Grade Level Criteria

* Data Visuals
    + There are three graphics present, but they are not easy for the reader to understand. 
    + The graphics are messy: very little thought is put into incorporating the four basic principles of design.

* Blog Content and Organization
    + The blog has a general structure, but there are many sections that read like a stream of consciousness. 
    + There are some headings and subheadings, but these are not scannable, and they do not help the reader find more information
    + There is some explanation of how the data was manipulated, but this explanation is either very vague or so specific that a general audience could not understand it. 
    + Little, if any, thought has gone into the reader's reading experience: paragraphs are too short or too long and bullet points are used excessively or not at all. 
    + The blog might identify the most realistic (re)presentation of data, but there is either a very limited explanation of why this is the most holistic representation, or the explanation is so specific that a general audience wouldn't understand it. 

* Writing Quality

    + Language is very vague and/or very industry-specific. It might be assumed that the audience had the same level of knowledge about the subject matter as the writer.

    + Sentences are very wordy and/or long.

* Writing Quality 
    + Sentences are often incomplete and/or difficult to follow. 
    + Language is vague and/or inappropriate for the audience.
