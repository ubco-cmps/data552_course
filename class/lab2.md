# Writing Assignment #2 - Proposal and Report Outline

**Due:** March 11th, 2021

## Instructions

This is a two-part assignment.
Part one is a proposal and part two is an outline.

Both parts will be done individually.

### Part One: 

Please write a 2-page semi-formal proposal requesting approval to conduct data analysis and prepare a report on one of the problems outlined below. The report, which you will complete as your fourth (4th) writing assignment will outline patterns behind the observed problem and propose a possible solution to the problem.  

In this assignment, however, your goal is to bring the problem/situation to the audience’s attention and to highlight why examining this problem further will help the audience achieve their goals.

### Part Two:

The second part of the assignment asks that you prepare a tentative outline of the report following the MACJ technique introduced in class.

## Observed Problems

Please **select one of the three choices below to write your proposal on**. Note that this will also be the scenario you will ultimately write your report on.

### 1. Interior Health
You work for Kelowna General Hospital, and you’ve noticed that emergency room wait times have been increasing. You’ve also noticed more public conversations about emergency room and surgical wait times. You believe that your data science knowledge may be able to help the hospital understand the problem and develop strategies to mitigate it. You would like to prepare an unsolicited proposal offering to do an analysis of the reasons why patients come to the emergency room, for how long they stay, and when they tend to come most frequently.

### 2. Real Estate in Kelowna and Surrounding Areas
You work for a company that purchases homes and then re-sells them for a profit. You’re also aware that real estate sales in Kelowna and the surrounding region are in decline. You believe that your data science skills could help the company decide if purchasing a home in Kelowna (or the surrounding area) is a smart investment. You have decided to propose conducting a data analysis and preparing report outlining Kelowna’s current real-estate market and potential investment opportunities.

### 3. A Dataset from One of Your Previous Classes

If you would like to prepare a proposal (and ultimately write a report) using a dataset from a previous class (including your DATA 551 project), you may do so. However, you will need to send me (Firas) a Slack message with a description of the dataset and a potential scenario that might cause you to propose looking further into the data. If you have a dataset, but no potential scenario in mind, let me know: we can come up with one together.

## Content, Organization, and Rubric, Formatting  

The proposal and outline should be two separate documents. As these are short documents,they do not require a Table of Contents.

### Email Cover Letter:

The proposal and outline should be accompanied by an email cover letter outlining the attachments, your purpose for sending them, and what you would like to email receiver to dowith them. You will also wish to include an email conclusion that tells the audience what you would like them to do next.

### Proposal:

Your proposal should include

* A brief introduction to the problem and why it is one that must be addressed in order to
help your audience achieve their (company’s/organization’s) goals,  
* Your proposed project, including how this project solves the need(s) identified in the
introduction/background, and any associated costs  
* Your plan for tackling the project.  

Remember that when you write a proposal, you are “selling” not only the project, but also your ability to complete it (better than anybody else).  

The proposal should make use of both headings and bullet point lists as appropriate. The tone is formal. Sentences are clear, concise, specific, and written in active voice. There is no use of jargon.  

If appropriate, your proposal can include a nicely formatted graphic that takes into account the audience’s needs.  

### Outline:

The outline should be no longer than a page. It should include a general outline of what you plan to cover in your final report and where you plan to cover it. The outline should also indicate where you plan to include graphics.
